"text","Today, I'll be teaching you the basics of data analysis. It probably makes sense to start by defining the word DATA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"data",NA
"text","According to Wikipedia, ""Data are values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items.""",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"data",NA
"text","Often the ""set of items"" that we are interested in studying is referred to as the POPULATION. Data analysis usually involves studying a subset, or SAMPLE, of an entire population.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"sample vs. population",NA
"figure","Here is a diagram showing the relationship between a population and a sample.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mod1_pop_vs_samp.R","new",NA,"sample vs. population",NA
"text","Data analysis should always start with a specific question of interest. For example, we might ask ""What percentage of people living in the United States are over six feet tall?""",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"sample vs. population",NA
"text","Here, our population of interest is everyone living in the US. Since it's impractical to measure the heights of over 300 million people, we could instead choose 100 people at random and measure their heights. Our hope would be that this sample of 100 people is REPRESENTATIVE of the entire US population.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"sample vs. population",NA
"question","Let's quickly test your understanding of the term REPRESENTATIVE. If you were interested in studying the health of men living in the US, ages 18-25, which sample would be more representative of the target population: a sample of 50 men who live in a nearby retirement home, or a sample of 50 men who are students at a local university?","mandatory","multiple","Men living at the retirement home; College students","College students","Since your target population is all men ages 18-25 living in the US, which of these 2 sample populations more closely matches the population of interest?",NA,NA,NA,"sample vs. population",NA
"question","Let's try another example to make sure you fully understand the idea of a representative sample. If you were interested in studying a group of African animals and how they adapt to climate change, which sample would be more representative of the target population: a sample consisting of 25 lions and 25 cheetahs, or a sample consisting of 25 kangaroos and 25 koala bears?","optional","multiple","25 lions and 25 cheetahs; 25 kangaroos and 25 koala bears","25 lions and 25 cheetahs","Since your target population is all African animals, which of these 2 sample populations more closely matches the population of interest?",NA,NA,NA,"sample vs. population",NA
"video","Would you like to watch a video on these topics now?",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"http://youtu.be/sRArT81TVEM","sample vs. population",NA
"text","The purpose of analyzing a sample is to draw conclusions about the population from which the sample was selected. This is called INFERENCE and is the primary goal of INFERENTIAL STATISTICS.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"text","In order to make any inferences about the population, we first need to describe the sample. This is the primary goal of DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"text","If we want to describe our sample using just one number, how would we best do it? A good start is to find the center, the middle, or the most common element of our data. Statisticians call this the CENTRAL TENDENCY.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"central tendency",NA
"text","There are three different methods for finding such a number and the applicability of each method depends on the situation. Those three methods are called the MEAN, MEDIAN, and MODE.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"central tendency",NA
"video","Would you like to watch a brief video on mean, median, and mode?",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"http://youtu.be/h8EYEJ32oQ8","central tendency",NA
"question","Mean, median, and mode are all measures of ____________.","mandatory","text",NA,"central tendency","This is a fancy term for the ""middle"" of a dataset.",NA,NA,NA,"central tendency",NA
"question","Which of the following terms are of most importance when describing the central tendency of a data set?","optional","multiple","median, mode, range; statistics, population, mode; population, sample, representative; mode, median, mean","mode, median, mean","These are the three different methods  stated above that are used for describing the center of a data set.",NA,NA,NA,"central tendency",NA
"question","To illustrate these concepts, we will now look at a real life dataset. Type 'cars' and press Enter to see the dataset we'll be working with.","mandatory","command",NA,"cars","Type 'cars' and press Enter. Do not use quotes, spaces, or uppercase letters.",NA,NA,NA,"R-command",NA
"text","You'll notice the rows are numbered 1 through 54, each representing exactly one car in the dataset. For each car, the following VARIABLES, or characteristics, are reported: 'type' (small, midsize, large), 'price' (USD), 'mpgCity' (city miles per gallon), 'driveTrain' (4WD, front, rear), 'passengers' (total capacity), and 'weight' (lbs). ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"R-command",NA
"text","We'll be focusing on the 'mpgCity' variable in this lesson. For simplicity, let's extract it from our dataset and store it in a new variable.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"R-command",NA
"question","Access the 'mpgCity' variable from the 'cars' dataset using the 'dataset$variable' notation.","mandatory","command",NA,"cars$mpgCity","Use 'dataset$variable' notation. Remember the name of our dataset is 'cars' and the name of the variable we are interested in is 'mpgCity'.",NA,NA,NA,"R-command",NA
"question","Now try accessing the 'driveTrain' variable from the 'cars' dataset using the 'dataset$variable' notation. ","optional","command",NA,"cars$driveTrain","Use 'dataset$variable' notation. Remember the name of our dataset is 'cars' and the name of the variable we are interested in is 'driveTrain'.",NA,NA,NA,"R-command",NA
"question","Now store the contents of the 'cars$mpgCity' in a new variable called 'myMPG'.","mandatory","command",NA,"myMPG <- cars$mpgCity","Use the assignment operator to assign 'cars$mpgCity' to a new variable called 'myMPG'.",NA,NA,NA,"R-command",NA
"question","Further, store the contents of the 'cars$driveTrain' in a new variable called 'myDrive'.","optional","command",NA,"myDrive <- cars$driveTrain","Use the assignment operator to assign 'cars$driveTrain' to a new variable called 'myDrive'.",NA,NA,NA,"R-command",NA
"text","The ARITHMETIC MEAN, or simply the MEAN or AVERAGE, is the most common measurement of central tendency. To calculate the mean of a dataset, you first sum all of the values and then divide that sum by the total number of values in the dataset.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mean",NA
"text","However, when there are many values of interest, it becomes tedious to do this calculation by hand. Luckily R has a built-in function for computing the mean. The syntax for doing so is 'mean(variable)'.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mean",NA
"question","Compute the mean value for the 'myMPG' variable now.","mandatory","command",NA,"mean(myMPG)","Use the 'mean' function by typing 'mean' followed by the name of your variable placed in parentheses. Don't use any spaces.",NA,NA,NA,"mean",NA
"question","Also, try to compute the mean value for the 'myDrive' variable now.","optional","command",NA,"mean(myDrive)","Use the 'mean' function by typing 'mean' followed by the name of your variable placed in parentheses. Don't use any spaces.",NA,NA,NA,"mean",NA
"text","Extreme values in our dataset can have a significant influence on the mean. For instance, if there was a car in our dataset that got 200 miles per gallon, this would inflate the mean upwards. This could be misleading since none of the other cars get anywhere near this gas mileage.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mean",NA
"text","An alternative to the mean, which is not influenced at all by extreme values, is the MEDIAN. The median is computed by sorting all values from least to greatest and then selecting the middle value. If there is an even number of values, then there are actually 2 middle values. In this case, the MEDIAN is equal to the MEAN of the 2 middle values. Don't worry if this is a little confusing. It will become more clear with practice.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"median",NA
"question","R also has a function for computing the median of a dataset and this is done by typing 'median(variable)'. Find the median value of your 'myMPG' variable now.","mandatory","command",NA,"median(myMPG)","Use the 'median' function by typing 'median' followed by the name of your variable placed in parentheses. Don't use any spaces.",NA,NA,NA,"median",NA
"question","Second, find the median value of your 'myDrive' variable now.","optional","command",NA,"median(myDrive)","Use the 'median' function by typing 'median' followed by the name of your variable placed in parentheses. Don't use any spaces.",NA,NA,NA,"median",NA
"text","Finally, we may be most interested in finding the value that shows up the most in our dataset. In other words, what the most common value in our dataset? This is called the MODE and it is found by counting the number of times that each value appears in the dataset and selecting the most frequent value.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mode",NA
"question","Use the 'table' function to see how many times each value appears for your 'myMPG' variable. The syntax for this function is the same as for the others you've seen.","mandatory","command",NA,"table(myMPG)","Type 'table' followed by your variable name placed in parentheses. As usual, leave out the spaces.",NA,NA,NA,"mode",NA
"question","Now, try using the 'table' function on your 'myDrive' variable.","optional","command",NA,"table(myDrive)","Type 'table' followed by your variable name placed in parentheses. As usual, leave out the spaces.",NA,NA,NA,"mode",NA
"question","Look at your table for the 'myMPG' variable that you created above. The first row gives you the value of your variable and the second row gives you the number of times it appears in your dataset. Since the mode is the value of our variable that appears most frequently, what is the mode of your 'myMPG' variable?","mandatory","exact",NA,"19","Keep in mind that the mode is the value of the variable that is most common, NOT the number of times which it appears.",NA,NA,NA,"mode",NA
"question","This time look at your table for your 'myDrive' variable. What is the mode of your 'myDrive' variable?","optional","text",NA,"front","Keep in mind that the mode is the value of the variable that is most common, NOT the number of times which it appears.",NA,NA,NA,"mode",NA
"text","Congratulations! You've made it through your first lesson. We introduced basic concepts related to data and data analysis. Specifically, you learned three important measures of central tendency: mean, median, and mode. You also know how to compute these using R.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
